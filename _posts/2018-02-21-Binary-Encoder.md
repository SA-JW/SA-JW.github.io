Binary Encoder

In today's lesson we tried to create an encoder that made a message into binary. We did this by finding the ASCII for all of the major keys. This gave a table which allowed me to create a relationship between a digit and a binary figure. I copied and pasted this into a sheet. I then wrote out hello into alternated cells underneath each cell I then wrote a vlookup statement with the ASCII. This then transferred it into binary
