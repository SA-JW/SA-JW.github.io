    <td>I found that I did well at thinking logically about what each statement meant. This helped me to fully understand what I was coding. I was less stressed out when I got something wrong which helped me to spot my mistakes easier.</td>

    <td>I need to try and work faster because I think that true or false was an easy task that I could've done quicker. There was also a section on electronics that I didn't get onto which I think is quite bad of me.</td>
