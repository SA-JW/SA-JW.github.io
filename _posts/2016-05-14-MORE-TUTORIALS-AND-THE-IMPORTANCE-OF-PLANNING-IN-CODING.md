MORE TUTORIALS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING IN CODING

In our last IT lesson, we continued working through some of the 'Code Kingdoms Cookbook'. Me and my friend Max, were working through the Flashpoint tutorial expansion task, which is to implement a three point scoring system. We thought up a very simple code for this,  expecting it to work, but it didn’t.  Then we began to try a more complicated code to see if that worked, but still the same outcome occurred. After about 20 minutes to half an hour at hacking away and trying to get the code to work, our teacher called the class to sit in front of the whiteboard. He began to talk about the importance of planning in code. The reason it helps is because you can take the problem outside the programme and make it easier to understand. We were given an example of a plan and our IT teacher asked us to find the mistake. The plan went something like this.

Pizza= 250

Burger=150

Pasta=100

Cake=50

If choice 1= "pizza" change value to 250

The reason this is wrong is because pizza is a string value at the bottom of the code, but a variable at the top which means that the string and the variable have no link between each other. This was an obvious mistake to me when my teacher put this example on the board, which shows how useful a plan is to help you see mistakes. If you would like to see another blog post on this topic I've left a link down below to Max’s blog.
