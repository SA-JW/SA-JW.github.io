In todays lesson we finished off looking at functions. In this group of exercises I used the range statement to loop through a group of numbers which I could then repeatedly use. A lot of the exercises involved using the for loop again which I have had a lot of practice with. The other thing that I used the most was the .append piece of code, this allows you to add pieces to lists.
