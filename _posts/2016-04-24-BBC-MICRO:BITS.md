BBC MICRO:BITS

In the 1980's, the BBC released a programming device called the Micro to introduce children to coding. Following it’s success, in 2015, the BBC released its latest version,  BBC Micro:bit. My school has applied for these Micro:bits, but ours have yet to arrive. Fortunately we were able to go onto the Micro:bit website and practice the four different types of code: Javascript, Microsoft Block Editor, Microsoft Touch Develop and Micro Python. Three of these codes have handy tutorials on how to code certain games and other cool things happen. My personal favourite code is the Javascript which is most useful for people starting out programming - instead of having to type the code out, it’s put into blocks which you drag onto the screen. This may sound easy, but quite a lot of logic is involved with the task. The next easiest script to use is Block Editor which is a lot like Scratch, (another code teaching software),  and also like the Javascript, except that the blocks are written out in non code form.  Now I know what you’re thinking, surely that’s easier than Javascript, but it’s quite confusing on which block connects to which. A more challenging script to use is Touch Develop. I can’t particularly talk much about this script as I haven’t had a proper look into it yet. More handy information may appear in a later blog post.  By far, the hardest code to use is Micro Python as this doesn’t appear to have a tutorial at the moment and is typed out properly in code form rather than in blocks like the other examples.
