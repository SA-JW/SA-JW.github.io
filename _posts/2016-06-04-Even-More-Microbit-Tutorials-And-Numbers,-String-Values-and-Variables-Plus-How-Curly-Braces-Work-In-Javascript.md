Even More Microbit Tutorials And Numbers, String Values and Variables Plus How Curly Braces Work In Javascript 

In the last IT lesson, before the school exam week and half term, we were continuing the code kingdoms cookbook tutorials. At the start of the lesson our teacher asked us to be seated at the front of the classroom so that he could explain something. On the interactive whiteboard screen was the Javascript coding page with three chunks of code on it - these were a number, a string value and a variable. Our teacher explained that a number is either a digit from 0-9, which you can do Maths with. A string value is a string of letters, usually used in code for a computer to say, you cannot do maths with these. A variable is a value that will change throughout the code. With this new knowledge me and my friend Max went on to tackle the 'worst snake ever' tutorial. Within roughly ten minutes we had completed the main task and began to try the extension task - this was to implement a wrapping system around the outside of the Microbit for the players dot to be able to appear out of the other side. For 20 minutes me and Max worked away trying to get the extension to work, but with no such luck. Eventually, we began working with about another 3 or 4 people who were also stuck, but the same outcome occurred. Our teacher, once again, called the class to the front to talk to us about ‘curly braces’. Curly braces {} are used in code to link certain commands to each other, for example.

	function onStart(  ) {

	

}

The two braces are in place to keep all the code functioning when the script is run. Curly braces always come in pairs so an easy way to tell if you are missing one out in a script is to count how many you have. If there are an even amount you're not missing one, if there are an odd amount you’re missing one out.
