SOCIAL MEDIA RULES AND ADDICTIONS

Social media is good in many ways.  Firstly, we can promote ourselves to other people, friends or bosses/managers. You can also benefit by planning trips with friends via social media when you are older. These are just a couple of examples of why social media is great. But as well as these perks, there are many threats on social media like groomers, flamers, trollers etc, but if you use it wisely, it can be an amazing and useful piece of soft-ware to use. In our last lesson we discussed this by creating ten rules: 

**1: Don't follow trollers**

**2: Don't click on adverts probably hackers.**

**3: Enjoy social media but be careful what you post.**

**4: Don't reply to trolls/ troll or flame people **

**5: Be yourself and don't get peer pressured you are who you are.**

**6: Don't try and change/groom people to be what you want or to fit your needs.**

**7: You can talk to people globally and some of it is free.**

**8: Don't share your personal information because people can stalk you pretend they are you (imposters). **

**9 Help people out if they are being bullied but equally don't get yourself into an argument  because you’re protecting someone else.**

**10: Meet new people this is what soci****al ****media is for.**

**11:  Only let people you know follow you or see your posts.**

**12: Try and be helpful if someone has a query.**

As well as being fairly dangerous, social media can be extremely addictive. Advertising campaigns will put this in their adverts. This can be seen in the Twitter The Musical advert (URL down below). We debated this in our lesson, seeing what aspects of social media are addictive. Some of the points that were raised included people want to know gossip and find out what our friends are up to. Another thought is that we want to show ourselves off to other people, and make them want to be our friends and have a feeling of importance. People will also use social media in a narcissistic way, this means taking the perfect selfie all the time and worrying about what they look like in them and generally disconnecting from the world. In class we saw a video demonstrating this (the URL will be left down below). The point I'm trying to get over here is that you have to have the correct amounts of things in life, e.g we all need water to survive, but if we have too much we will drown. This is taking it a bit far as social media won’t kill you, but the world does seem a bit more lifeless with it - there is less face to face interaction and communication than previous generations.
