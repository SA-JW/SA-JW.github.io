In today's lesson I continued to work on the Student Becomes the Teacher section. This continued to look at lists and dictionaries and consolidated some of the work and skills that I had learnt previously. One thing that I have taken out of this lesson, is that I need to be careful with my syntax. The instructions had asked me to create an empty list inside a function. I did this but put a comma after the last brace. I am only supposed to use commas if there are lots of keys inside of a dictionary, both of these criteria were not met. I spent a good 15 minutes trying to figure out what the problem was and then realised that there wasn't supposed to be a comma. I need to proof read my code after I have written it to check for silly errors like this.
