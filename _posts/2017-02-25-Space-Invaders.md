    <td>I found that, once again, reading through the booklet and thinking logically about each statement, without prompt from it, developed my understanding of the code more. I think that I have also improved on last weeks target, which was to keep my focus. This with a combination of thinking logically about the code helped develop my understanding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my memory. I misplaced the memory stick that I used to save my Fuzebox, which did not hinder my learning in this lesson, but will set me back in next lesson. Another aspect that I need to work on is my typing ability. This is not a major attribute that I need to work on but it is slowing me down in lessons and seeming as the next code I am working on is a large one, it will be harder for me to spot my mistakes so I need to keep my typing skills accurate to keep mistakes to a minimum.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I must always check that my memory stick is in my I.T folder before I leave for school, before the lesson and after the lesson. I must proof read sections of my work to see if I have made typing errors.</td>
