(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There were useful tutorials on a website called W3schools that helped with the CSS coding. On the web page I found tutorials on colour picking, fonts and generally what looks nice on your blog. As for the Fuze Boxes there is a handy instruction booklet that comes along with it. This tells you exactly what to do, but explains what you have done in a simple, user friendly manner.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that when something goes wrong, I either give up or change the code back. This means that the code I create is very simple and lacks detail. I think that I should take more risks when coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to start taking risks and attempt to write complex code correctly. I think I could do this by doing research on online web resources like W3schools. I also think that I should try to find guides on the internet that explain the coding that you have done in a simple way. If I have this basic understanding, then I could expand on that allowing me to have more complex and interesting code.</td>
