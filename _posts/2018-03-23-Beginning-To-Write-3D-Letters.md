Beginning To Write 3D Letters

In todays lesson we started to write our initials in 3D. You begin by writing the letter out, which I can do by using a function of the code which I wrote in last lesson. After this, you need to make it into a block letter, like bubble writing. Then you choose a perspective and using simple geometry, you create it into 3D using simple geometry and angle work.
