Recaping what we have done so far

In today's lesson, we began to recap the stages of what we had done. First of all we began by creating a stock list, this was a list of items we would sell, next to this we assigned prices. Next to this we created a column that listed the items in the stock list, we did this by going to data, data validation and then entering A:A, this set up a dropdown of our different items. Next to this we used a vlookup statement. Vlookup will look up a vertical column or columns in this case to find a value related to an object. We then added a quantity column which is surprise surprise the quantity of an item, and next to this created a function that would times the price by the quantity, and to top it all off, a function that added all of these together. After this we added a discount. To do this we made a variable that is the number of items needed for discount, something that said how much was off and then an if statement that asked if the number of items bought is greater than or equal to the number of items needed, then take the discounted price of, if not then just display the original price.
