I am trying to be able to write the code without much hint from the prompts at the side, only reading enough to understand what I have to do.</td>

    <td>I need to read some of the instructions more carefully, so as not to make silly mistakes like missing out capitals, brackets, commas etc. While I'm beginning to learn python I may need to postpone the target above, but eventually I think that may be a good way to improve my learning.                                  </td>
