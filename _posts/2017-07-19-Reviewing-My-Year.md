I think that I have made a good amount of progress this year in IT, but there are some things that I need to improve on. My general work ethic has improved and I think that I value IT more. When I have found a problem, rather that getting frustrated, I have thought systematically towards correcting it, going through different stages to find the answer. To improve next year I think that I will need to stick at a problem for longer and try to find the answer, try to fully understand what I am doing before advancing, as this will cause issues further on in the future. I enjoyed doing python, especially when given a freedom to try and do what I want to a piece  of code to advance it.
