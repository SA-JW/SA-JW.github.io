TRYING TO MAKE A SINGLE DISCOUNT

In today's lesson I attempted to create a discount on a single item. I managed to create the discount for the item, and take 10% off it, but I couldnâ€™t find a way to check if I had bought a certain amount of items, and therefore take the discounted item off the discount. If there was an AND code that worked in spreadsheets to see if two statements were true simultaneously, I could do this. Another way I have tried it is by making different cells say different things, which means that other cells can check this, but it is extremely complex and hard to keep track of.
