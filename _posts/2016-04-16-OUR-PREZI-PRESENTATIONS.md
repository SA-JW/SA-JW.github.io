OUR PREZI PRESENTATIONS

Over the Easter holidays my IT teacher asked the class to create a Prezi Presentation on "The History of Computers". In this week's lesson , we looked at examples of what to do and what not to do on Prezi. The first classmateâ€™s presentation we looked at had several  points of improvement, including the following -  the font was difficult to read on the background - there needed to be more of a contrast between the background and font colour; the wording and grammar was incorrect so it was difficult for the reader to understand the information on display. In a previous brief from our teacher he told us to write each section in chronological order - this example presentation also did not meet this criteria. The good pointers to this presentation were that the author had included lots of information, possibly too much, and most of the transitions between slides were fairly smooth. The second and third presentations also had similar problems.  However, in the 3rd and final presentation that we looked at, the information was was displayed simply in an easy layout, making it easy to understand.  Mine is yet to be shown - I wonder what the feedback will be?
