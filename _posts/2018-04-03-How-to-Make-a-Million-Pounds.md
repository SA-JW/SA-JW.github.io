How to Make a Million Pounds

In today's lesson, we began working on a prime number recogniser, but first we looked at how to tell if something was even. We have to grasp the idea of modulo. Modulo is the % sign in coding. The two numbers that are placed around the modulo operator will divide and print the remainder. If you define a function with n in the perentheses first, and then set up an if statement that divides n by a number and returns the remainder. If there is a remainder then it isn’t divisible by 2 and if there isn’t it is. You can do this with prime numbers however you have to do modulo with lots of numbers to see if they return a remainder, to get past this use the square root of the number. If you discover a new prime number then you get a million pounds, however it is a massive number that would take ages even just to type in, let alone run the function.
