In this batch of homework exercises I looked at the Student becomes the Teacher exercises, these led on from the work in dictionaries that I have previously done. In these exercises I had to create dictionaries with floats in them, which was very easy as I've done it many times before. The next part was a bit trickier, and I had to loop back through the dictionaries and calculate the averages of the floats.
