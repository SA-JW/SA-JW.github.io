MICROBIT SORTING HAT TUTORIAL

In our last IT lesson we were shown a tutorial on how to create the Harry Potter sorting hat on a Microbit -  (I will leave a link to that tutorial down below for you to try out). This format was written in the touch develop code. The tutorial is great for getting to grips with the idea of input, output and process. The input in the sorting hat tutorial is on press button A - this sends a signal to begin the script. The output are the different house's - these are the words that will be generated and displayed at the end of the script. The process is the actual way that the computer chooses a house at random. The way that the microbit does this is by assigning a number to each house and then choosing one number at random.  In my last blog post, I mentioned that the touch develop was one of the hardest codes to use from the choices on the Microbit.  However, now that I’ve had a proper look into this script, I have found that it is probably the easiest to use.  That’s my opinion - maybe you will disagree!
