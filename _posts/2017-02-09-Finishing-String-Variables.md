    <td>Thinking logically about what each statement meant. Along with using the work booklets, it was useful to think about each statement in my head, as this helped to increase my understanding of what is going on in my script.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to try to keep my focus, I could do this by trying to do interesting things with my code, as well as going along with the booklet. I’ve tried experimenting before and I think that I concentrate a lot more on what I’m trying to do because I enjoy what I’m coding. It also helps me to understand what I’m doing more.</td>
