TRYING TO EMBED MY SHEET INTO MY BLOG

In today's lesson I attempted to embed my Virtual shop into my blog. I know how to this, I simply need to go to my github and add a few lines of code that will allow me to so, this was an iframe. This was the easy bit. You can then style this any way you like using techniques on w3schools. To embed a sheet you need to go to the app or the web page, open your sheet and then click on file on the top of the page, not at the top of your desktop. When the dropdown has come up you need to go to publish to wb and click on embed. In theory it should give you an option to copy the Iframe, but for me it didnâ€™t. Next lesson I will try to figure a way to this.
