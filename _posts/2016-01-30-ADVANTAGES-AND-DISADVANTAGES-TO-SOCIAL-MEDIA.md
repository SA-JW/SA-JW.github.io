ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO SOCIAL MEDIA

When you get home from school and you go on to your i-pad, do you go on to social media - Instagram, Snap Chat, Twitter, etc? If so, do you actually realise the advantages and disadvantages of using it? We discussed this in our last I.T lesson, in which we drew a table of advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are you can speak to friends that you haven't seen in awhile, you can promote a business via social media, you can meet new people, you have immediate access and most social media is free to use. Of course, there are many disadvantages with social media including it can be very addictive, you are judged by what you write and post, there are groomers - people who befriend you and then isolate you, ask you to join some terrorist organisation, or kidnap you and murder you. There are also online trollers and many other threats like peadophiles and hackers who want your information. Later in the lesson we were given various scenarios - for example,  your parents post on social media that they’re going away for the holiday and your house is empty for two weeks and you post a picture of your cat on social media. We then had to order these into the most dangerous situation and the least dangerous situation. With the two examples I have given now, your parents posting that you’re going away for two weeks is the most dangerous and you posting your cat is the least. The reason that it is in this order is because if you post that you are going away burglars know when to break into your house. If you post a picture of your cat, the only danger is people find your cat follow it home and know where you live, this, of course is very unlikely.
