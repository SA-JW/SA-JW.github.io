Today we looked at how functions work by thinking about different problems. We looked at making a cup of tea and came up with a list of instructions for it. They were fill the kettle up with water, set to boil, fetch teacup, fetch tea bag, put tea bag in teacup, if water has boiled pour water in teacup, else wait for water to boil, + sugar, + sweeteners, +  milk. When you look at the first command, there are actually a lot of instructions. you have to think about how much water you put in the kettle, turning the tap on, lifting the lid of the kettle and so on. We also thought about this scenario in a coding sense and tried to tell a robot arm to make a cup of tea. During this thinking time we came across several problems that the arm would face, like not being able to pick up the kettle because it was too far away. We fixed this problem by placing it in the same place every time. Another challenge we faced was how it would turn the tap on so we had to change the tap. This thinking time was supposed to teach us that functions have very complicated instructions in them, but in Python the function is easy to understand by a computer like filling a kettle is easy for us. We had another discussion about attitude towards solving problems and it is only as complicated as you perceive it. The moral was that if you think you can solve a problem then you can solve it gradually until you have solved it fully.
