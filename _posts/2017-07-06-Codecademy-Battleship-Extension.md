In today's lesson, me and my friend decided to work together on extending our Battleship code. First of all we looked at changing the board size - this was very simple and all we had to do was change the number when the board is printed, change the for turn in range() statement and change the number in the parameters and also change the number that causes the "You missed my Battleship" statement. The second thing we did was create a second player, once again this was quite easy and all we had to do was copy and paste all the code in the for loop that runs all the statements after a player enters coordinates, with this we had to differentiate between two players. One way we could extend this to a bit further is if we made the print statement the winner of the game. One problem we faced was that the code ran an error statement when you didnâ€™t write a coordinate so we are now going to try  to fix this.
