Buzzfeed Quizzes

In today's lesson we began to think about how to create a Buzzfeed quiz. We began to think about what they were figuring out and also how we could replicate that. We thought about how it got to the answer and realised that it could come out with a boolean (true or false) answer, each answer adds points to a certain thing and whichever one has the most points is the answer, a bar which you fill and when you get a certain level that is the answer. We then began creating questions and figuring out which method to use.
