Using Functions to Make Code More Complex

In today's lesson, we began to learn about how to use functions to change the way it runs. Rather than running procedurally, instead, you can add in functions so that it is more complex and will cut around your code. It is like creating flashbacks and jumps in time in a story to break up the chronology of the story in order to make it more complex and interesting. We used this in our quizzes. We created a function called main this contained a dictionary with the final score. I then defined a function that would append the answer into the dictionary depending on the answer a-e. I will then create a function that will sort through this to find the most answered letter.
