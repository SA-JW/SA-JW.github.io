    <td>I found that I worked thoroughly and accurately last lesson and I worked well on understanding what I was doing. Beginning this new topic I think that the Fuze Box leaflet helps me to understand what I am doing. Later on in this new program I am sure to incorporate previous techniques.</td>

    <td>Going back to one of my first targets, I think that I am getting to frustrated with myself when I make mistakes. I will make a mistake and try to fix it by doing one thing, but then that won't work, so I will try a similar thing to fix it. This won’t work and the cycle will repeat and then after 10 minutes I will figure a way to fix it and it will be completely different to everything I’ve tried.</td>
