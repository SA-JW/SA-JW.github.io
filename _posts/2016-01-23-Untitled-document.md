MEDIA DECEPTION

Have you ever seen an advert, gone to buy the product advertised and when you've got it you think this is nothing like the advert. Well this is media deception. I have three examples of this. When you see a McDonalds advert and the burger is really big and you see all the lovely filling inside, they havenâ€™t made that one in the space of two minutes like they do when you order one in the restaurant, they spend around a week making it, photographing it and then editing that photo. Another is a Duracell campaign. They were saying in an advert  that their Ultra Advanced and Ultra Power batteries were better and lasted longer than other companies, however they were more expensive than regular batteries and did not provide longer life than other alkaline batteries. This resulted in them being sued in the US. UK gamer Tom Cassell, know as TheSyndicateProject, was one of the vloggers who received 20,000 pounds to upload two promotional videos endorsing the Xbox One to his Youtube channel, via Machinima online entertainment network. Viewers did not know that he was being paid by Machinima to promote the console. The failure to disclose the fact broke US laws governing deceptive advertising. Machinima must now say why vloggers and gamers are backing a product.
