Beginning to Create Our Quizzes

In Today's lesson, we began to create our quizzes. We began by breaking down what the quiz would contain - questions, responses and how the final outcome would work. The way to code this is to start off with an opening statement, and then ask the first question. After that create a variable name and = input and then in a string all of the answers, A-Z depending on how many choices you have. Next go back to above that section create variables, depending on how many responses there are. Then you want to create a series of if and elif statements that say if A was chosen then + 1 to this variable. At the end create an else statement that won’t add to a variable and that is to make sure you don’t continue when you have random answers. In order to loop that section after the else statement create a while loop that goes while == answered, obviously before this creating a variable named answered = 0. After each response write answered += 1 to make the variable increase and then exit the while loop.
