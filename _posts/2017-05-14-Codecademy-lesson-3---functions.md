Last lesson I began learning about functions. These allow you to reuse pieces of code. There are many ways you can use a function but by far the most confusing to me was imports. These allow you to call a set of variables and functions that can help with your coding. I think that what I found most confusing was which way is the correct way to import these variables and functions. My favourite part of this topic was using the max(), min(), abs() and type() function. The max() function allows you to calculate the highest number in an argument, the min() function calculates the smallest number in an argument, abs() calculates how far that number is from zero and type() figures out if something is a string, number or decimal.
