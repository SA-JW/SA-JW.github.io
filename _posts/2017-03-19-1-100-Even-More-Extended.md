    <td>I think that I worked on trying to incorporate targets and techniques from previous lessons well. I feel that I was working well on guessing the type of code that came next, this is effective in making me understand my code well. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to work more thoroughly. I have spent several weeks working on this 1-100 code and I think that I'm not working quick enough in lesson times. This may be down to a number of factors including: getting side tracked (a previous target which I think I’m alright at), my typing ability which is slow and my partner’s ability to get sidetracked. </td>
