(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I found that experimenting with my code developed my understanding further. One example of this was the hello world script. The script runs and writes hello world, but you have to change lots of punctuation so that it works. I developed my understanding by experimenting by changing the colour of the text and the paper and taking parts of the code out to see the outcome. We also continued to use workbooks which explained the code.</td>

    <td>I'm still getting frustrated and need to calm down. This happened in class once when I had written the code correctly and it came up with the correct message, but it came along with an error message. I did not notice the number and only saw the error message, so I changed the script and spent 15mins doing so. When I reverted it back to the original, I saw that it was correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to properly read what the outcome of the code is and I need to be more calmer when things go wrong and be less frustrated.</td>
