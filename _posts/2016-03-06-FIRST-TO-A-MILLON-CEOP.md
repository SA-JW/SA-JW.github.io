FIRST TO A MILLON - CEOP

In my last IT lesson we were shown a bunch of videos called "First to a Million" - link to the first video is listed below which then links to the other videos. WARNING: THE VIDEO IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOUNGER AGED VIEWERS UNDER 11 DUE TO SOME STRONG LANGUAGE AND SCENES. These clips are interactive and allow you to make choices at the end of each video, they also make you feel as if you are a character in the story. The basic summary of the narrative is a group of three people start out as amateur film-makers, who make a bet with one of the members older brothers, who is also making videos, that they can get a million views on Youtube quicker than him. The members of the group begin making one of their friends do loads of stupid stuff to get more views, but this makes him fall out with the other members. The boy who has had to do the stupid challenges ends up putting revenge porn onto the Youtube channel getting himself in trouble with the two people he took the video of. This actually has a lot of knock-on effects with the people involved. These videos were created by CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection.) They wanted teenagers to realise that they have to be in control of their actions and not to do stupid things on the internet. If you want more advice you can visit another page called “CEOP Think U Know”. On that site you can choose an age group. From there you can read or watch loads of guidance videos and pages.
