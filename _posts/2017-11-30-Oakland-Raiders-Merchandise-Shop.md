Oakland Raiders Merchandise Shop

In today's IT lesson, we began to look at spreadsheets. In this exercise, we created a virtual store, selling stock of our choice, mine was selling the merchandise of my favourite American Football team. In my spreadsheet, I managed to create a successful system that calculated the price of stock related to the quantity, very similar to the dictionary work in codecademy. First I created a table that listed my stock, with the prices marked next to them. Then I made a cell in which I wrote an item of stock, and next to that I made a cell which used the code =vlookup(D2,A:B,2,false), this found the piece of stock and the price next to it. I then made a quantity column which you can simply add the integer of price, and then after that, simply multiplied the unit and quantity column together
