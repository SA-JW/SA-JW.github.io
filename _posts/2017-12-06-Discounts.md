Discounts

In today's lesson, we looked at putting items on sale. The way to make this is to make a discounts heading and enter a percentage which is going to be removed from the final price. After this we create a heading with items required. Next to this enter an integer that will be the number of items required to allow the discount. Next you can make a discounted price heading, and next to this we create a cell that uses the code =if(F8>=F10,(G6-(G6/F9)),G6). This checks to see if the number of items is above the number required, and then finds the percentage.
