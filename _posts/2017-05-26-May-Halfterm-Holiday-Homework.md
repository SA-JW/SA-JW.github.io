Completed exercises: Python lists and dictionaries 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

In this set of exercises I found number 9 the hardest. I got confused about where I had to put the number squared part because I kept on putting it in the .append section as this is what the instructions asked. I found number 12 the easiest because the exercise had helpful comments and i think the layout helped me visualise it better.

Completed exercises Python lists and dictionaries 14, A day at the Supermarket 1, 2

Today I found exercise 14 the hardest. It was confusing about what went inside the parenthesis and when to use the braces but I think that going back to previous exercises helped refresh my memory about what to do.

Exercises completed: A Day at the Supermarket 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

In these exercises I looked at using dictionaries and for loops. For loops allow you to loop through a list to search for certain values or strings. In order for this to work you need to accompany it with an if statement which looks through the values in the list.

Completed exercises: A Day at the Supermarket 8, 9, 10, 11

These set of exercises were difficult and tested my ability to use for loops to run through a dictionary.  The exercises were also testing my ability to change the values in a dictionary and use maths symbols to change the values of a variable
