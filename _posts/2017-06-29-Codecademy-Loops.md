Today I worked on the loops section in codecademy. In this section I learnt how to use the while loop, which allows you to complete an action while something is running in your code; I also extended my use of the for loop and learnt how to use that with the while loop. I am hoping that after I have completed this section it will aid me in extending the battleship code. Using the while loop could help make statistics as when the game over screen is running I can print these statements
