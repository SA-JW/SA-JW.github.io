Technology Survey and Finishing Off the Microbit Tutorials

In the last IT lesson, our teacher had posted a technology survey on our google classroom feed - this had questions about what types of technology we have, whether our parents check those pieces of equipment, if we have restrictions on the computers and finally questions about sexting. The second half of the lesson was occupied by beginning to finish the microbit tutorials that I have previously talked about. The school I attend has finally received the BBC Microbits, and soon we will be starting to create our own games. I've come up with two ideas for games at the moment, a golf game and a 21 questions game. The golf game, works a bit like the Maze runner tutorial. You will have to guide a ball through a course of obstacles to reach the hole. The 21 questions is simply like the original game. The microbit will ask questions, on a certain topic, and you will answer yes or no (A or B) until the microbit comes to a final conclusion.
