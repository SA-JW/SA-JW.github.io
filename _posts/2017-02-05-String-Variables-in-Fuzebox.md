(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I now have a good grip on how string variables and how to use them. I think that I could generate my own code using them without the booklet.</td>

    <td>I began to experiment with the code. Using string variables, which allow you to store information about a variable, I tried writing my name  and other words by storing syllables as the string variables. I didn't get frustrated with my code and could now see the mistakes I was making and realised why the error message appeared last week.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reading the booklet code rather than the explanation. I keep on  copying the code in the work booklet and skim read the explanation. I need to read into this in more depth, so as to have a better understanding of the code. This could also help me to experiment more, as I can use previous knowledge to create a script.</td>

    <td>read the instructions in the manual manual fully so that I understand what the code  I have written actually means and how it works.</td>
