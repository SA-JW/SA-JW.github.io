Deciphering Sheet

In today's lesson, we began creating a google sheet that made a word into a cipher. We did this by making two columns, the first with the letters of the alphabet, and the next with different letters assigned. Then I made the top row the message HELLO WORLD. Underneath this I deciphered the message, by doing a command that said iferror(vlookup(E1,$A:B,2,false),) what this did is that it checked what the letters were and then assigns the ciphered letter. What I did next was that I made a command that said CONCATENATE(E3:O3). What this does is that it makes everything on that row appear in one box, which allows me to copy and paste the message without the individual cells.
