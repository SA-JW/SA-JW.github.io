Continuing With Using Functions

We began by creating a function with the parameters question,a,b,c,d,e etc. We then printed each individual letter and the question. We then did a while loop and the framework for how a question will take in information and use it. We then created a list which contained all of the questions and answers, what the actual words were, not just the letters. We then created a list of those lists. We then created a function that would go through that list and find questions and would ask them in the structure.
