Projections

In today's lesson we learned how to project how much money our Stock would make in a certain amount of time. We did this by copying the items and price list from my original sheet and then added a new tab and pasted it onto here. Next I created a random number of stock, and next to this added a random number of the items sold. Then I created a list in which I bought all of the items, which was at a lower price than what I sold them at. Lastly I calculated the profit, which I did by doing the stock sold times the price  minus the stock bought times the price bought.
