In today's lesson I learnt about lists and dictionaries. Lists are strings or numbers, called an index, inside of braces e.g [] and dictionaries are keys inside of curly braces e.g {}. The lists allow you to store several pieces of information under one variable. You can then slice these lists by entering the range of values inside of the list. A dictionary works by assigning a string with a value using a colon. You can then call this string and it will give you the value.
