AI

In today's lesson, we began to create our own AI’s. We began to look at different AI, specifically one that passed the turing test three times and one that hadn’t. The Turing test is a test to see whether a group of people can tell if it is AI or a human. They are asked to have a conversation with an AI and a human and guess which is which. They have 5 turns per AI. If they can guess it in over half, they have failed if under then it has passed. We began with simple questions, but we realised that it couldn’t respond to all of them, so instead we asked closed questions, so we could control the conversation.
