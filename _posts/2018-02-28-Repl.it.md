Repl.it

In today's lesson we bagan work on repl.it. We used the python with turtle which allows you to draw things with an arrow using lines of code. We started by simply telling the arrow what to do like turtle.forward(120) and turtle.right(90) and then repeating it 4 times to make a square. We then created variables for the length and the number of sides so that we could create lots of different shapes. We then used for number in range and then set it to the number of sides lowest, number of sides highest to create a string. You can use a while true loop to create a cool shape. Here is some code for a cool flower pattern

import turtle

turtle.speed(500000)

turtle.shape("turtle")

def draw_shape(sides,length):

  for number in range(sides):

    turtle.forward(length)

    turtle.right(360/sides)

    

for number in range(1, 8):

  draw_shape(number, 20)

  while True:

    for number in range(1, 8):

      draw_shape(number, 40)

      turtle.right(40)
