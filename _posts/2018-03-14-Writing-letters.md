Writing letters

Today we went back to the python with turtle and began to draw letters. To do this we began by looking at the letter A. The turtle has to turn 75 degrees left and move forward 200 pixels. Then the turtle has to move so that it does the other baseline and to work this out you do 180 - 30 = 150. Then move forward 200 pixels, then back 80, then turn right 105 degrees and then 400 pixels forward. We then did calculations like this for other letters.
