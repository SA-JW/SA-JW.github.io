Hello and welcome. This is my first proper blog post and I will be talking about media, text and subtext in adverts.

	In an advert there are certain details you see and don't have to interpret - this is called text. In this post I will use the Volkswagen Passat advert as an example. In the advert a kid can be seen dressed up as Darth Vader trying to use the force on all kinds of objects and make them float or move them. When his Dad comes home from work he tries the force on his car, his Dad locks it and the child feels as if he has used it.

	The subtext in an advert is the hidden message or messages behind it and what it is trying to tell you. There are three main subtexts in this advert. One is Volkswagen appealing to children to get them to pester adults to buy this car. The second is them telling you that buying this car will make you feel empowered. The last is more the target market of who they are aiming for. I think that they aim for people that have just started a family as the car looks safe and family friendly.
